If you don't override a class's equals() method, you won't be able to use those objects as a key in a hashtable and 
you probably won't get accurate Sets, such that there are no conceptual duplicates.

The equals() method in class Object uses only the == operator for comparisons, so unless you override equals(), 
two objects are considered equal only if the two references refer to the same object.

The equals() Contract
---------------------
■ It is reflexive. For any reference value x, x.equals(x) should return true.
■ It is symmetric. For any reference values x and y, x.equals(y) should return true if and only if y.equals(x) returns true.
■ It is transitive. For any reference values x, y, and z, if x.equals(y) returns true and y.equals(z) returns true, 
then x.equals(z) must return true.
■ It is consistent. For any reference values x and y, multiple invocations of x.equals(y) consistently return true or 
consistently return false, provided no information used in equals comparisons on the object is modified.
■ For any non-null reference value x, x.equals(null) should return false.

Note:
-----
To guard against the possibility that name or hireDay are null, use the Objects.equals method. The call Objects.equals(a, b) returns 
true if both arguments are null, false if only one is null, and calls a.equals(b) otherwise.

equals() method with inheritance
---------------------------------
• If subclasses can have their own notion of equality, then the symmetry requirement forces you to use the getClass test.i.e.
		if (getClass() != obj.getClass())
			return false;
why it forces symmetry?
Ans: For ex if e is an Employee object and m is a Manager object, both of which happen to have the same name, salary, and hire date.
If Employee.equals uses an instanceof test, the call returns true. But that means that the reverse call m.equals(e) 
also needs to return true.			

• If the notion of equality is fixed in the superclass, then you can use the instanceof test and allow objects of different 
subclasses to be equal to one another.
		if(!(this instanceof other))
			return false;

NOTE: The standard Java library contains over 150 implementations of equals methods, with a mishmash of using instanceof, 
calling getClass, catching a ClassCastException, or doing nothing at all. Check out the API documentation of the java.sql.Timestamp 
class, where the implementors note with some embarrassment that they have painted themselves in a corner. The Timestamp class 
inherits from java.util.Date, whose equals method uses an instanceof test, and it is
impossible to override equals to be both symmetric and accurate.

Here is a recipe for writing the perfect equals method:
-------------------------------------------------------
1. Test whether this happens to be identical to otherObject:
	if (this == otherObject) return true;
This statement is just an optimization. In practice, this is a common case. It is much cheaper to check for identity 
than to compare the fields.
2. Test whether otherObject is null and return false if it is. This test is required.
	if (otherObject == null) return false;
3. Compare the classes of this and otherObject. If the semantics of equals can change in subclasses, use the getClass test:
	if (getClass() != otherObject.getClass()) return false;
If the same semantics holds for all subclasses, you can use an instanceof test:
	if (!(otherObject instanceof ClassName)) return false;
4. Cast otherObject to a variable of your class type:
	ClassName other = (ClassName) otherObject
5. Now compare the fields, as required by your notion of equality. Use == for primitive type fields, Objects.equals for object fields. 
Return true if all fields match, false otherwise.
	return field1 == other.field1
	&& Objects.equals(field2, other.field2)
	&& . . .;
If you redefine equals in a subclass, include a call to super.equals(other).

Key interfaces in java collection framework are 
Collection, List, Set, Queue, Map, SortedSet,SortedMap,NavigableSet, NavigableMap.

Legacy collections Vector, Hashtable are synchronized.

Searching a collection using Collections class can be done with binarySearch() method. For searching collection has to be sorted first. 
If comparator is used for sorting, then same comparator has to be passed for searching also. 

binarySearch() method returns an integer representing the index of the element if found. Unsuccesful search returns a negative integer
which represents the insertion position. If search returns an index -n, then insertion position is (-(n)-1)). If search returns -3, 
then insertion position is 3-1.i.e. 2.

Note:Searching an array that was not sorted will give unpredictable results. Similarly, using compartor either with sorting or with 
searching but not both can also result in unpredictable results.

Java 6 introduces two interfaces NavigableSet and NavigableMap to collection API. To describe these, here is an example.
	TreeSet<Integer> times = new TreeSet<Integer>();
	times.add(1205); 
	times.add(1505);
	times.add(1545);
	times.add(1830);
	times.add(2010);
	times.add(2100);

If we want to know the biggest number before 1600 and smallest number after 2000, in java 5.
	TreeSet<Integer> subset = new TreeSet<Integer>();
	subset = (TreeSet)times.headSet(1600);
	System.out.println("J5 - last before 4pm is: " + subset.last());
	
	TreeSet<Integer> sub2 = new TreeSet<Integer>();
	sub2 = (TreeSet)times.tailSet(2000);
	System.out.println("J5 - first after 8pm is: " + sub2.first());
	
In java 6, same can be achived using lower() and higher() methods like this.
	System.out.println("J6 - last before 4pm is: " + times.lower(1600));
	System.out.println("J6 - first after 8pm is: " + times.higher(2000));	

Note: similarly there are other methods like ceiling(),floor() etc. For maps, there are lowerKey(),floorKey() etc. 

Note: The difference between lower() and floor() is, lower returns an element lessthan the given element, whereas floor() 
returns an element lessthan or equal to the given element. Same with celiling and higher methods.
